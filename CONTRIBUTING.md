# Contributing to OptiPowerTools.ScheduledJobsInsights

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone with submodules:

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/<your-username>/OptiPowerTools.ScheduledJobsInsights.git
   ```

2. Create a branch for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Build and run tests:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet test
   ```

## Development Setup

- **.NET SDK required:** 10.0
- **Docker** is needed for SQL Server (used by the dev web site)
- **Git with submodule support** — the `sub/MyOptiAlloySite/` submodule provides the Optimizely CMS 13 Alloy site for manual testing
- **`dotnet-ef` global tool** — required if you change the EF Core model in `src/OptiPowerTools.ScheduledJobsInsights/Data/`. Regenerate the migration with:

  ```bash
  dotnet ef migrations add <Name> \
    --project src/OptiPowerTools.ScheduledJobsInsights \
    --startup-project src/OptiPowerTools.ScheduledJobsInsights.Web \
    --context OptiPowerTools.ScheduledJobsInsights.Data.ScheduledJobsInsightsDbContext \
    --output-dir Data/Migrations
  ```

See the [README](README.md#development) for full setup instructions.

## Code Style

- **C#:** File-scoped namespaces, Allman braces, 4-space indent, `var` for apparent types
- **JSON/XML/YAML:** 2-space indent
- **Naming:** `_camelCase` for private fields, `PascalCase` for public members
- **Patterns:** Options pattern (`IOptions<T>`), DI via extension methods, expression bodies preferred, pattern matching over casts
- **Warnings as errors** is enabled — your code must compile warning-free

## Testing

- Use xUnit with NSubstitute for mocking
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use `[Theory]`/`[InlineData]` for parameterized tests
- Tests run against net10.0

Run the full test suite before submitting:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Submitting Changes

1. Ensure all tests pass and the build is warning-free
2. Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit
3. Write clear commit messages that explain *why*, not just *what*
4. Open a pull request against the `main` branch
5. Describe what your PR does and why in the PR description
